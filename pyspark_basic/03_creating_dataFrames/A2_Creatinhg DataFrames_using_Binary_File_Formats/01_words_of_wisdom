Apache PySpark supports several binary file formats, which can be particularly useful for handling large datasets or when dealing with complex data structures that benefit from binary serialization for efficient storage and faster processing. Here are the commonly used binary file formats that PySpark can handle:

1. Parquet:
        A columnar storage file format optimized for use with Apache Hadoop. PySpark
        supports reading and writing Parquet files, which is often preferred for big
        data processing due to its efficient data compression and encoding schemes.

2. ORC (Optimized Row Columnar):
        Similar to Parquet, ORC is a type of columnar storage that aims to improve the
        performance of read, write, and processing of data in Hadoop. It is well-supported
        in PySpark for scenarios requiring efficient data compression and large-scale data processing.

3. Avro:
        A row-based binary file format designed for serializing data in a compact binary format. It is
        used for data serialization and supports rich data structures. PySpark can read and write Avro
        files, although it might require adding an external library depending on the Spark version.

4. SequenceFile:
        A Hadoop-specific, flat file format consisting of binary key-value pairs. It is widely used in
        Hadoop environments for passing data between the output of one MapReduce job to the input of
        another.

5. Image files:
        Starting from Spark 2.4, PySpark can read binary files including images as binary files directly,
        treating them as binary records - useful for machine learning scenarios where images are used as
        input data.

Hereâ€™s how you might read each of these formats in PySpark:

### Reading Parquet Files

df = spark.read.parquet('/path/to/parquet_files/')


### Reading ORC Files

df = spark.read.orc('/path/to/orc_files/')


### Reading Avro Files

# Might require configuration or importing avro packages
df = spark.read.format("avro").load('/path/to/avro_files/')


### Reading SequenceFiles

from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("ReadSequenceFile").getOrCreate()
rdd = spark.sparkContext.sequenceFile('/path/to/sequence_files/')
df = rdd.toDF(['key', 'value'])


### Reading Image Files

df = spark.read.format("image").load('/path/to/image_directory/')
